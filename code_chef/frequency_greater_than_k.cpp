// lexiographic order -> order in which words in a dictionary are arranged 
// ordered map / sorted map / ordered dictionary 
// types of ordered map 
// insertion order -> sorted based on the order in which they were inserted
// sorted order -> based on the lexiographical or custom order
// this diffres from hash maps as elements are in order unlike hash maps (i.e. ordered maps). 
// frequency map / frequency counter / tally map / histogram -> used to store the count of ouccerence of elements i.e. keys: values :: element: count_of_that_element
